## üéØ Project Overview

- **Client:** SKY Engineering Department
- **Challenge:** Replace manual spreadsheet-based health assessments with a robust web application
- **Solution:** Full-stack Django application supporting multiple user roles and comprehensive team health visualization
- **Team:** 2 developers (collaborative development using Git)

## üöÄ Key Features

### Multi-Role Authentication System
- **Engineers:** Vote on health check cards, view team summaries
- **Team Leaders:** Manage team views, access departmental data
- **Department Leaders:** Department-wide analytics and reporting
- **Senior Managers:** Cross-departmental insights and strategic overview

### Health Assessment System
- **Traffic Light Voting:** Green/Amber/Red health assessments across 10+ health cards
- **Progress Tracking:** Historical data visualization and trend analysis
- **Session Management:** Organized assessment periods with data persistence
- **Team Analytics:** Automated vote aggregation and team health summaries

### Security & Access Control
- **Role-based Permissions:** Granular access control based on organizational hierarchy
- **Secure Authentication:** Django's built-in authentication with profile management
- **Data Privacy:** Individual votes protected, only aggregated data visible to managers

## üèó Technical Architecture

### Backend
- **Framework:** Django 5.0 with Python 3
- **Database:** SQLite with complex relational schema
- **Authentication:** Django's built-in user management
- **Data Models:** Department ‚Üí Team ‚Üí Engineer hierarchy

### Frontend
- **Templates:** Django templating engine
- **Styling:** Bootstrap 5 for responsive design
- **JavaScript:** Interactive voting interface and form validation
- **UX Design:** Intuitive navigation with role-specific dashboards

### Database Schema
- Departments (1:N) ‚Üí Teams (1:N) ‚Üí Engineers
Health Cards ‚Üê Votes ‚Üí Sessions
Users ‚Üê Profiles ‚Üí Roles

## üõ† Technical Implementation

**Key technical challenges solved:**
- Complex many-to-many relationships between users, teams, and assessment data
- Role-based view rendering with Django's permission system
- Aggregated data visualization without exposing individual votes
- Scalable database design supporting organizational growth
